update_hts_files.py -> This script needs to perform the following operations:

    1) Use the downloaded <htsdata.json> file from CBP to create the json list of records (this will be a long list of files that will be discarded after successful addition to the DB).
    This process is twofold:

        - Create the json files folder with the records: 0101.json, 0102.json ... so on.
        - Create the string_dict folder with the string_dict.json file (These are the keywords extracted per record for string query)
    
    2) From the temp folder in the db_hts folder (where we will store the json parsed files from before) we will add these json files as documents in a MongoDB collection.

        - One collection is going to be the hts_records collection, that will have as documents each of the json file's information on hts records.
        - The other collection is going to be string_dict, this will have as documents each of the elements inside the string_dict json file

        Both of these collections will be linked to one another via de hts header (0101, 0102... etc)

    3) When the MongoDB records are created, we will remove the information from the temp folder in order to save space.
