This script functions as a fully automated workflow that uses the writeFiles_workflow() as its entry point:

    1) writeFiles_workflow(1) -> Takes as first parameter the HTS_dict dataframe created using:

        1.A) createHTSDict(1) -> This takes the path of the original HTS file with all the records and returns a full dataframe of all records.
    
    2) writeFiles_workflow(2, 3, 4) -> The second, third and fourth parameters in this function are the folder paths for:
        
        - The 2nd parameter takes the path for the raw JSON hts folder to save the files extracted for each 4 digit chapter in the original hts file
        - The 3rd parameter takes the path for the folder where we'll save the String information
        - The 4th parameter takes the final path for the folder where the JSON processed files will be saved (without empty keys) -> For storage in the db

    After this step we proceed to use the create_db script in order to upload all the files into Mongo.
