Querying the database for HTS results can be done by the user in 4 different scenarios of input:

    1) Base chapter query:
        
        -INPUT = '####'

        The user inputs only the first 4 numbers of the HTS they are looking for, which will yield a result of all possible subrecords of that specifc chapter of 4 digits.

        -TYPE = <List>
    
    2) Base_subrecord query:

        -INPUT = '####.##'

        The user inputs the 4 first numbers plus the sub-record 2 numbers of the chapter, this yields a more specific set of records pertaining to the sub-record.

        -TYPE = <List>

    3) Base_semifull_record query:

        -INPUT = '####.##.##'

        The user inputs 8 digits of the HTS query, going to the second level records, this yields an even more specific set of results.
        Or it can yield a complete record in the cases of the Chapter 99 records, which are 8 digits long.

        -TYPE = <List> | <Single>


    4) Complete_record query:

        -INPUT = '####.##.##.##'

        The user inputs the total 10 digit record, this yields a single record information.

        -TYPE = <Single>
