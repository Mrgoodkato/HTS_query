-CONNECTION:
    Using MongoDB, we connect using pymongo, and the class Connection as follows:

    class Connection:
    """Class that connects to the database creating all necessary methods for connection and closing connection, as well as the base database for adding new HTS records and the string_dict collection too
    """

    def __init__(self, db_path: str):
        """_init_ function of the class, defines the connection variables

        Args:
            db_path (str): Path to the database connection on MongoDB
        """

        self.client = pymongo.MongoClient(db_path)
        self.db = self.client['hts']
        self.collection_records = self.db['hts_records']
        self.collection_string_dict = self.db['string_dict']

        def closeConnection(self):
        """Close connection function, closes current connection created in the Connection class
        """
        self.client.close()

    This class basically creates the client, db and collections objects to access, query and modify the database.

    To connect we use the following method:
    connection = Connection(f'{PATH_DB}{USER_DB}:{PW_DB}@{CLUSTER_DB}') -> This is saved in the .env folder under the credentialsDB.py file, or can be gathered in the MongoDB site.


-CLOSING CONNECTION:
    Don't forget to close the connection to the db after any operation is complete, it can be done like this:
    connection.closeConnection()
